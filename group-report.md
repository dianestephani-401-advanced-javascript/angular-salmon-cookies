# JS Framework Comparative Analysis
## Team Angular
**Research Conducted By:** Edgar Romero, Diane Stephani, Jonathon Lee, Sarah Shatto

## General Comments
Front end JS Framework. Definitely efficient to use, but wasn't efficient for us to learn.

### Pros
- Good documentation to follow.
- Can use the CLI to generate all the necessary files for a component: HTML, CSS, TypeScript.

### Cons
- Difficult to use if you don't know the language.
- Documentation is good, but should be more straightforward to use. We struggled to switch back and forth between all the tabs. 

## Documentation
- [Angular.io](https://angular.io/docs)


## System Requirements
- Angular/cli
- Node
- Jasmine
- Karma
- Protractor
- Typescript
- Bootstrap
- Material UI

## Ramp-Up Projections
1-2 hours. We had some growing pains just trying to figure out how to work with TypeScript. We also struggled to style using Bootstrap, and switched over to Material UI.

## Community Support and Adoption levels
Angular was built by Google and released in 2010. It's one of the most popular frameworks, but it's become less popular than React and is slowly getting replaced by Vue.
